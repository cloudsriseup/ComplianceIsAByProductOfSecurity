    <description>A vulnerability in the IP Version 6 (IPv6) packet processing functions of multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to stop processing IPv6 traffic, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient processing logic for crafted IPv6 packets that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) packets to an affected device for processing. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop processing IPv6 traffic, leading to a DoS condition on the device.  This vulnerability is not Cisco specific: any IPv6 processing unit not capable of dropping such packets early in the processing path or in hardware is affected by this vulnerability.</description>
