    <description>A vulnerability in the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) module of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to the way certain malformed DNS packets are processed on an affected device when those packets undergo Network Address Translation (NAT). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DNS packets to be processed and translated by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device that would lead to a DoS condition.</description>
