    <description>Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in Cisco IOSÂ® Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device when SIP operation is enabled. Remote code execution may also be possible.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. For devices that must run SIP there are no workarounds; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure of the vulnerabilities.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-sip["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-sip"].  Note: The March 24, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Security Advisories. All the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on March 24, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html"]</description>
