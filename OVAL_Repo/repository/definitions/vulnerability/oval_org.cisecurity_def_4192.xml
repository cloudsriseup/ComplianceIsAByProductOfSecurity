    <reference ref_id="CVE-2017-6606" source="CVE" />
    <description>A vulnerability in a startup script of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to the targeted system to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the root user.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of ROMMON variables values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the content of some ROMMON variables, which will allow an external script containing the command to execute at boot time. A reload of the affected system is needed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would need console access to exploit this vulnerability.</description>
