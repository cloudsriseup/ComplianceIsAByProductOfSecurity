    <description>A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a device reload.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKE version 1 (IKEv1).  Although IKEv1 is automatically enabled on a Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software when IKEv1 or IKE version 2 (IKEv2) is configured, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv1 packet.  In specific conditions, normal IKEv1 packets can also cause an affected release of Cisco IOS Software to leak memory.  Only IKEv1 is affected by this vulnerability.  An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.</description>
