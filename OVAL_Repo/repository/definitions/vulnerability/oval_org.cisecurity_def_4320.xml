    <description>Multiple Cisco products contain either of two authentication vulnerabilities in the Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3) feature. These vulnerabilities can be exploited when processing a malformed SNMPv3 message. These vulnerabilities could allow the disclosure of network information or may enable an attacker to perform configuration changes to vulnerable devices. The SNMP server is an optional service that is disabled by default in Cisco products. Only SNMPv3 is impacted by these vulnerabilities. Workarounds are available for mitigating the impact of the vulnerabilities described in this document.  Note: SNMP versions 1, 2 and 2c are not impacted by these vulnerabilities.  The United States Computer Emergency Response Team (US-CERT) has assigned Vulnerability Note VU#878044["http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/878044"]  to these vulnerabilities.  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2008-0960["http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2008-0960"]  has also been assigned to these vulnerabilities.
