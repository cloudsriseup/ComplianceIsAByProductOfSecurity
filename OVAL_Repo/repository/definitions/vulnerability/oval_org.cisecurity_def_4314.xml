    <description>Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol which provides a secure remote access connection to network devices.  The SSH server implementation in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contains a DoS vulnerability in the SSH version 2 (SSHv2) feature that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a device to reload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting a reverse SSH login with a crafted username. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to create a DoS condition by causing the device to reload. Repeated exploits could create a sustained DoS condition.  The SSH server in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software is an optional service, but its use is highly recommended as a security best practice for management of Cisco IOS devices. SSH can be configured as part of the AutoSecure feature in the initial configuration of IOS devices, AutoSecure run after initial configuration, or manually. SSH is enabled any time RSA keys are generated such as when an http secure-server or trust points for digital certificates are configured. Devices that are not configured to accept SSHv2 connections are not affected by this vulnerability.</description>
