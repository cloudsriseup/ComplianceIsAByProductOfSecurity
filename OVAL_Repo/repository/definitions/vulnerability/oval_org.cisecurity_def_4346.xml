    <description>A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause autonomic nodes of an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to an unknown condition in the Autonomic Networking code of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by replaying captured packets to reset the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) channel of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reset the ACP channel of an affected system and consequently cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.</description>
