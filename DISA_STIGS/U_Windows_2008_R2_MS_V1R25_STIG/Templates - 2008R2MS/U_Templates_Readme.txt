The scegrevl.inf file will update a system to show additional security options (MSS settings) in a policy.  Directions for updating this file are included in the STIG Overview.

The Security Templates that have "Analyze" as part of their file name, should not be used to configure a production system.  They are meant only for use with the Security Configuration and Analysis snap-in to the MMC to Analyze the security configuration of the system.

These templates may break a production system if they are used for configuration which may require software to be reinstalled or re-imaged.
