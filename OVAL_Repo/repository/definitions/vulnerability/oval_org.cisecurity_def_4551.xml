    <description>A vulnerability in the packet reassembly subsystem of Cisco IOS-XE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to consume CPU resources which may lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability is due to an error message that is triggered to the console and the syslog when a fragmented packet cannot be properly reassembled. When an affected device fails to successfully perform reassembly, instead of silently dropping the fragments, the ATTN-3-SYNC_TIMEOUT error message may be triggered. On a device that is highly loaded, this condition may be leveraged to consume CPU resources that may be required by another process, resulting in a temporary halt of the queued process. In some situations this may lead to a drop of transit traffic. An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by sending a series of IPv4 or IPv6 fragments, that are designed to trigger the error message, directly to the affected device.  Cisco IOS-XE devices rate-limit error messages to once every 60 seconds by default.</description>
