    <description>The H.323 implementation in Cisco IOS Software contains two vulnerabilities that may be exploited remotely to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a device that is running a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS Software.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities other than disabling H.323 on the vulnerable device if H.323 is not required.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-h323["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-h323"].  Note: The March 24, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes seven Security Advisories. All the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on March 24, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar10.html"]</description>
