    <description>A vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking feature of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to reset the Autonomic Control Plane (ACP) of an affected system and view ACP packets that are transferred in clear text within an affected system.  The vulnerability is due to unknown reasons. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by capturing and replaying ACP packets that are transferred within an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reset the ACP of an affected system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to capture and view ACP packets, which should have been encrypted over the ACP, in clear text.</description>
