    <description>A vulnerability in the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to leverage any trusted key, not just the trusted key for its address.  The vulnerability is exists because ntpd does not properly verify that the key being used matches the proper servers' key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending packets with any trusted key, as long as the keyid references another key the systems share and that key is used to compute the message authentication code (MAC). An exploit could allow the attacker to masquerade as another configured trusted association.</description>
