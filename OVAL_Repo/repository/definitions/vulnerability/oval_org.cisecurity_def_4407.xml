    <description>Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) implementation in Cisco IOSÂ® Software that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device when SIP operation is enabled.  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds for devices that must run SIP; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure to the vulnerabilities.  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sip["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-sip"].  Note: The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22, 2010, or earlier:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-bundle"]  Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep10.html"]  Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Two separate Cisco Security Advisories have been published to disclose the vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco Unified Communications Manager at the following locations:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20090826-cucm["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20090826-cucm"]  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-cucmsip["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20100922-cucmsip"]</description>
