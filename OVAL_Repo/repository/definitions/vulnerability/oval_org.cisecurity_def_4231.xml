    <description>Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software contain a vulnerability in the RSVP feature when used on a device configured with VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) instances. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge, which can lead to loss of connectivity, loss of routing protocol adjacency, and other denial of service (DoS) conditions. This vulnerability could be exploited repeatedly to cause an extended DoS condition.  A device is vulnerable if it is configured with VRF and none of the interfaces in that VRF have RSVP enabled, but any other interface (physical or virtual) does have RSVP enabled.  An attacker with some knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit this vulnerability by sending RSVP packets to vulnerable devices. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to wedge the receive queue of any RSVP ingress interface.  A workaround is available to mitigate this vulnerability.</description>
